## Data Communication

### What is Data Communication

* Data communication is the process of transferring data between two or more devices using a communication channel
* It is the process of sending and receiving data between two or more devices
* It is the process of exchanging data between two or more devices

### Duplex Mode

* In a duplex communication mode, data is transmitted in both directions, either simultaneously or in an alternating pattern
* There are three types of duplex modes:
	1. **Half Duplex Mode**: Data is transmitted in one direction at a time, with the direction of transmission being switched after each transmission
	2. **Full Duplex Mode**: Data is transmitted in both directions simultaneously, with data being transmitted in one direction while data is being received in the other direction
	3. **Simplex Mode**: Data is transmitted in one direction only, with data being transmitted from one device to another device without any data being transmitted back in the other direction


## Network architecture and Structure

![alt text](image-2.png)

* It defines the structure and organization of a computer network
* It defines the protocols and standards used for communication between devices
* It defines the security measures used to protect the network from unauthorized access
* It defines the management and maintenance procedures used to keep the network running smoothly

### Peer to Peer (P2P)

* In a peer to peer network, each device is both a client and a server
* Each device is equal in the network and no device is more important than the other
* Data is transmitted between devices directly, without the need for a central server
* Each device is responsible for providing its own data and services to the network

Advantages:
* Scalability: P2P networks are highly scalable, as new devices can be easily added to the network
* Flexibility: P2P networks are highly flexible, as devices can be easily configured to act as both clients and servers
* Cost: P2P networks are cost-effective, as there is no need for a central server

Disadvantages:
* Security: P2P networks are vulnerable to security threats, as there is no central authority to manage the security of the network
* Performance: P2P networks can be slow, as data is transmitted directly between devices rather than through a central server
* Complexity: P2P networks can be difficult to manage and maintain, as there is no central authority to manage the network

### Client to Server (C2S)

* In a client to server network, devices are divided into two categories: clients and servers
* Clients are devices that request data and services from the server
* Servers are devices that provide data and services to the clients
* Data is transmitted between clients and servers, with the server being responsible for providing data and services to the clients

Advantages:
* Security: C2S networks are more secure, as there is a central authority (the server) that can manage the security of the network
* Performance: C2S networks are faster, as data is transmitted through a central server that can handle multiple requests simultaneously
* Ease of Management: C2S networks are easier to manage and maintain, as there is a central authority to manage the network

Disadvantages:
* Cost: C2S networks are more expensive, as there is a need for a central server that can handle multiple requests simultaneously
* Scalability: C2S networks are less scalable, as the central server can become overwhelmed if too many devices are added to the network
* Complexity: C2S networks can be more complex, as there is a need for a central server that can handle multiple requests simultaneously

### Layering Principles

* Layering is based on the principles of modularity, scalability, and abstraction
* Modularity is the process of breaking a network into smaller, independent components that can be easily managed and maintained
* Scalability is the ability of a network to be expanded or modified without disrupting the existing network
* Abstraction is the process of hiding the details of a network from the user, allowing for a simpler, more standardized interface for communication

### Services Offered by Layers

* Each layer in a network offers a specific set of services to the layers above and below it
* The services offered by each layer are dependent on the specific layer and its responsibilities
* The services offered by each layer are as follows:

### Connection-Oriented and Connectionless

* Connection-Oriented:

	+ Examples include TCP, HTTP, and FTP
* Connectionless:
	+ No connection is established between the sender and receiver before data is sent
	+ Data is sent without being acknowledged by the receiver
	+ If a packet is lost or corrupted, it is not retransmitted
	+ Examples include UDP, DNS, and DHCP
