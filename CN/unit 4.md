Here’s the entire **Transport Layer** topic — fully translated into **clear English** with the **same structure** and **exam-ready tone** 👇

---

### 🔸 Transport Layer

**Explanation**: The Transport Layer is the 4th layer of the network model. It ensures **reliable delivery** of data between sender and receiver by **breaking the data into segments** and maintaining their **correct order**. Its main job is **process-to-process communication**, i.e., sending data from one application to another.

**Example**: When you send a message on WhatsApp, the transport layer ensures the message arrives **in the correct order and without errors**. Protocol like **TCP** is used here for reliability.

---

### 🔸 Working of Transport Layer

**Explanation**: It splits the sender's data into **segments**, adds **headers**, and sends them. On the receiver's side, it **reorders and reassembles** these segments. It also handles **error detection and correction**.

**Example**: When you send an email, it is broken into pieces by the transport layer and reassembled properly at the receiver’s end. If any part gets corrupted, it’s re-sent.

---

### 🔸 At the Sender's Side

**Explanation**: The transport layer divides data, assigns **sequence numbers**, and uses **multiplexing** to manage data from multiple apps using **unique port numbers**.

**Example**: If you’re streaming music and uploading a file simultaneously, the transport layer handles each stream separately using different ports.

---

### 🔸 At the Receiver's Side

**Explanation**: It checks segment order, reassembles them, and sends them to the correct application. It also performs **demultiplexing** — identifying which app the data belongs to.

**Example**: If you're watching YouTube and chatting, the transport layer separates video and chat data and sends them to their respective apps.

---

### 🔸 Functions of Transport Layer

* **Segmentation and Reassembly** – Breaks and reassembles data.
* **Error Control** – Detects and corrects errors.
* **Flow Control** – Matches sender and receiver speed.
* **Connection Control** – Manages reliable/unreliable links (TCP/UDP).
* **Multiplexing/Demultiplexing** – Handles multiple app data.

**Example**: If you're gaming and on a call, the transport layer manages both separately. TCP is used for reliable calling, while UDP is used for fast gaming data.

---

### 🔸 Process-to-Process Delivery

**Explanation**: It ensures data is delivered from one **specific application (process)** on a device to another on a different device using **port numbers**.

**Example**: When you open a website in a browser, the data is routed to the browser app only — not some other app — using port numbers like **80 for HTTP**, **25 for email**, etc.

---

## 🔷 Transport Layer Protocols

---

### 1️⃣ **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**

#### ✅ Byte Streaming

**Explanation**: TCP sends data **as a stream of bytes**, not message by message. On the receiver side, the stream is reconstructed back into the original data.

**Example**: Sending a WhatsApp message — it's broken into bytes and reassembled accurately.

---

#### ✅ Connection-Oriented

**Explanation**: TCP uses a **3-way handshake** before sending data to establish a connection. It ensures a reliable link before data transfer begins.

**Example**: Opening a website triggers a handshake before content loads.

---

#### ✅ Full Duplex

**Explanation**: Both sides can send and receive data at the **same time** — enabling **two-way communication**.

**Example**: In a voice call, both users can talk simultaneously like a real phone call.

---

#### ✅ Piggybacking

**Explanation**: Instead of sending a separate ACK, TCP **sends the acknowledgment along with outgoing data**, improving efficiency.

**Example**: When receiving a message, the reply itself includes the ACK.

---

#### ✅ Error Control

**Explanation**: TCP includes a **checksum** in each segment. If errors are detected, the segment is **retransmitted**.

**Example**: If a WhatsApp message is corrupted, it's re-sent to ensure correctness.

---

#### ✅ Flow Control

**Explanation**: TCP adjusts sending speed based on the receiver's capacity using a technique called the **Sliding Window Protocol**.

**Example**: A slow receiver will advertise a smaller window so the sender doesn’t overload it.

---

#### ✅ Congestion Control

**Explanation**: TCP reduces its sending speed during **network congestion** using algorithms like **Slow Start** and **Congestion Avoidance**.

**Example**: If too many users access a website, TCP slows down the transfer to avoid crashes.

---

### 🧾 TCP Header Format

* **Source Port** – Port where the data originated.
* **Destination Port** – Port where data is going.
* **Sequence Number** – Maintains byte order.
* **Acknowledgment Number** – Confirms bytes received.
* **HLEN** – Header length.
* **Reserved** – 6 bits for future use.
* **Control Bits** – SYN, ACK, FIN for control.
* **Window Size** – Used for flow control.
* **Checksum** – For error detection.
* **Urgent Pointer** – Prioritizes urgent data.
* **Options** – Optional features like timestamp.

**Example**: SYN=1, ACK=0 = connection starting. FIN=1 = connection ending.

---

### 🔗 A TCP Connection (3-Way Handshake)

* Step 1: **SYN →**
* Step 2: **SYN + ACK ←**
* Step 3: **ACK →**

Then the actual data is transferred.

**Example**: When you open Google, TCP sets up this handshake first.

---

### 2️⃣ **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**

#### ✅ Why Use UDP?

**Explanation**: UDP is **fast** and **lightweight**. No connection is established — suitable for **real-time apps** where **speed matters more than reliability**.

**Example**: Games, video calls, and live streams use UDP. Losing a few packets doesn’t matter.

---

### 🧾 UDP Header Format

* **Source Port**
* **Destination Port**
* **Length** – Total length (header + data)
* **Checksum** – Basic error checking

**Example**: Watching online videos uses UDP for fast streaming, even if a frame or two drops.

### 🔷 TCP vs UDP (Comparison)

| Feature     | TCP                        | UDP                           |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Type        | Connection-oriented        | Connection-less               |
| Reliability | Reliable (ACK, retransmit) | Unreliable (no ACK, no retry) |
| Speed       | Slower (more checks)       | Faster (less checks)          |
| Ordering    | Maintains order            | No order guarantee            |
| Use-case    | Email, Web, File Transfer  | Gaming, VoIP, Streaming       |

**Example**: File download uses TCP for accuracy; games use UDP for speed.

### 🔹 TCP Window Management

**Explanation**: Receiver defines a **window size** (how much data it can accept). Sender sends data up to that size. Uses **Sliding Window Protocol** for efficient transfer.

**Example**: If the window is 5, sender sends 5 segments, then waits for ACKs before sending more.

---

### 🔹 Flow Control (TCP)

**Explanation**: Ensures sender doesn't send more than the receiver can handle. Uses **window size** from the receiver to regulate speed.

**Example**: Slow device advertises a small window; sender respects that limit.

---

### 🔹 Retransmission (TCP)

**Explanation**: If a segment is **lost or corrupted**, TCP **retransmits** it. Triggered by **timeout** or **duplicate ACKs**.

**Example**: No ACK in 1 second = retransmit. 3 same ACKs = fast retransmit.

---

### 🔹 Multiplexer (Sender Side)

**Explanation**: Combines data from multiple apps, assigns each a **unique port number**, and sends via one TCP connection.

**Example**: YouTube and WhatsApp running together use different ports.

---

### 🔹 Demultiplexer (Receiver Side)

**Explanation**: Identifies incoming data by **port number** and delivers it to the correct app.

**Example**: Data on port 80 goes to browser; port 25 goes to email.

---

## 🔷 Quality of Service (QoS)

**Explanation**: QoS manages **delay, bandwidth, loss**, and **priority** for data delivery — important for real-time apps.

**Example**: A smooth Zoom call with clear audio is due to QoS.

---

### ✅ How to Improve QoS

* **Over-Provisioning**: Extra bandwidth.
  *Example: 20 Mbps for 10 users.*
* **Buffering**: Temporary storage for handling delay.
  *Example: YouTube buffering.*
* **Scheduling**: High-priority packets sent first.
  *Example: Voice packets before others.*
* **Traffic Shaping**: Limits speed or data flow.
  *Example: Slowing downloads during peak hours.*

---

## 🔷 TCP Congestion Control

### 🔹 Congestion Window (cwnd)

**Explanation**: A dynamic window at sender side that adjusts based on **network traffic**. It grows or shrinks based on **ACKs** and **congestion**.

**Example**: Starts with cwnd = 1 → doubles as ACKs come → reduces if congestion is detected.

---

### 🔹 Congestion Policies

#### ✅ 1. **Slow Start**

Starts with **cwnd = 1**, and **doubles** after each ACK. Continues till it hits a **threshold**.

*Example: 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 16...*

---

#### ✅ 2. **Congestion Avoidance**

After reaching threshold, **growth becomes linear**. cwnd = cwnd + 1 after each ACK.

*Example: 16 → 17 → 18...*

---

#### ✅ 3. **Congestion Detection**

* **Timeout**
  TCP resets cwnd to 1 — starts Slow Start again.
  *Example: If no ACK in 2 sec, it restarts.*

* **Duplicate ACKs (Fast Retransmit)**
  On receiving 3 duplicate ACKs, TCP resends lost segment and cuts cwnd by half.

  *Example: If ACK 20 received 3 times, packet 21 is retransmitted immediately.*
