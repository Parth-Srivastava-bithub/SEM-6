Linear regression
Logistic regression
Bias theorem
Nav bias theorem
Types mathematical Bernoulli and Gaussian
Now explain what is training data what is training and what is prediction
Explain what is concept learning and steps in concept learning from define hypothesis space to collect training examples then initialize the learning algorithm then iterate through examples then generalize and specialize then evaluate the hypothesis
explain what is EM algorithm thumb and there's major concept like expectations tab and maximization step step then word king then there's a flow chart of it and there is initialization and then there is E and then there is M and then there is a loop and then there is a termination condition

Now explain the M stepconvergenceand the bias in belief networkand key concepts which are nodes edges and conditional probabilities
Also explain now support vector machine their key points which are hyperplane support vectors margins and kernel methods which have some four types which are linear polynomial and radial bias function which is rbf kernel and then sigmoid kernel

Write explain about decision tree learning algorithm and process of building a decision tree choosing the best features split the data set create a decision notes or leave notes repeatand then pruning in decision Tree
explain its advantages and disadvantages 
Now explain the inductive bias and information gain what is inductive bias and what is information gain

Explain the calculation of information gain its entropy its conditional entropy its information gain and ID3 algorithm after it with its processnow explain with formula of each and write formula under $$ $$ cuz i need to paste it on md format on github
Now under ID3 algorithm write explain each point compute entropy for each attribute calculate information gain for each attribute select the best attribute great decisionnode and create it repeat for each subset
Now the next topic is KNN algorithm
Explain all the steps of choosing the numbers of neighbours and calculating the distance identifying the K nearest neighbours and making a prediction with an example of numerical so that we can understand how it would work
Explain now explain the case based learning and what are the steps inside it which is retrieved reuse revise and retain and what are the Applications
