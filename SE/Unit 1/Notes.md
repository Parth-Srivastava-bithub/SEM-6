   - Software: Based on computer science, discrete mathematics, and evolving technologies

4. **Output Characteristics:**
   - Conventional: Physical products with mass production focus (cars, appliances)
   - Software: Digital products with versioning and continuous updates

5. **Change Management:**
   - *Conventional:* Design changes are extremely costly post-construction
   - *Software:* Code can be refactored relatively easier (though costs rise exponentially later in development)

6. **Testing Approach:**
   - Conventional: Final product testing (e.g., crash tests for vehicles)
   - Software: Continuous testing throughout development (unit tests, integration tests)

7. **Prototyping:**
