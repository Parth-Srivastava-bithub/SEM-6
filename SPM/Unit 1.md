**1.1 What is Software Project Management (SPM)?** 👇

---

### 🔹 **Definition**

Software Project Management (SPM) is the art and science of planning, leading, organizing, and controlling software projects. It ensures that the software is developed within time, budget, and meets desired quality. It involves coordinating people, processes, tools, and technologies from start to finish.

---

### 🎯 **Key Objectives of SPM**

1. **Deliver Software on Schedule**
   Timely delivery is crucial in software development. Delays can lead to budget overruns, client dissatisfaction, and loss of market opportunity. SPM ensures tasks are scheduled properly and progress is monitored using tools like Gantt charts or agile boards.

2. **Ensure High Quality**
   Quality is not just bug-free code—it includes usability, performance, maintainability, and security. Through reviews, testing, and quality assurance practices, SPM ensures the product meets or exceeds customer expectations.

3. **Manage Resources (Cost, People, Tools)**
   Resources include developers, designers, testers, tools, infrastructure, and finances. A good SPM strategy ensures optimal utilization of all resources—neither overburdening the team nor wasting time or money.

4. **Mitigate Risks**
   Every project faces uncertainties—tech failures, changing requirements, team issues. SPM identifies possible risks early, assesses their impact, and creates plans (like backups or alternative strategies) to avoid or handle them effectively.

### 📱 **Example: Mobile Banking App**

Imagine a bank wants a mobile app in 6 months.

* **Planning** includes defining scope, timelines, and team roles.
* **Execution** involves coding, testing, and review cycles.
* **Monitoring** ensures deadlines are met and bugs are fixed.
* **Control** deals with any issues—maybe a developer leaves or budget exceeds.
  SPM ensures the app is delivered on time, works smoothly, and meets user expectations.

### **1.1 What is Software Project Management?**

**Definition:**
Software Project Management is the art and science of planning, executing, tracking, and finishing software projects. It focuses on building software that meets user needs, is completed within the time limit, and stays within the allocated budget.

**Why is it important?**
Unlike physical products, software is invisible and abstract. That’s why it’s hard to measure progress without proper planning. SPM ensures that even in dynamic environments, the team delivers what was promised with minimal chaos.

### **Key Objectives of SPM**

**✅ 1. Deliver software on schedule:**
Time is critical in any business. SPM uses tools like timelines, Gantt charts, and agile sprints to ensure software is delivered as per deadlines without last-minute panic.

**✅ 2. Ensure high quality:**
SPM integrates testing, code reviews, and quality assurance from the start to prevent bugs and ensure that the final product meets performance and usability standards.

**✅ 3. Manage resources (cost, people, tools):**
Resources like skilled developers, testing tools, cloud infrastructure, and budget must be optimized. SPM helps allocate them smartly to avoid overuse or underuse.

**✅ 4. Mitigate risks:**
From scope creep to tech failure, risks can derail projects. SPM includes risk identification, analysis, and backup planning to avoid project disasters.

---

### **Example – Mobile Banking App Project**

Suppose a team is hired to build a mobile banking app in 6 months. SPM will start with defining scope (like login, fund transfer, statement view), plan how many devs/testers are needed, set deadlines for modules, choose tools like Flutter or React Native, estimate cost, and constantly track risks like security issues or third-party API failures. The SPM ensures all parts work together for smooth delivery.

### **3. Project Management Cycle**

**Phase 1: Initiation**
Set the foundation by identifying project goals, stakeholders (e.g., client, team), and performing feasibility studies. You answer: *Is the project worth doing?*

**Phase 2: Planning**
Here you create the roadmap. Define task timelines, estimate budgets, create risk management plans, and choose your development model (Agile, Waterfall).

**Phase 3: Execution**
The actual work begins. Coding, UI/UX design, integration, and testing are done. The team follows the planned schedule and keeps stakeholders in the loop.

**Phase 4: Monitoring**
Progress is tracked using tools like burndown charts (Agile) or Gantt charts (Waterfall). Issues like delays or bugs are identified and resolved early.

**Phase 5: Closure**
Once complete, the product is delivered. Final documents are prepared, reviews are conducted, and the team reflects on what went well or failed.

🌀 **Agile Example**
Agile simplifies this into fast cycles: Sprint Planning → Daily Dev Work → Sprint Review → Retrospective → Next Sprint.

### **4. SPM Framework**

SPM stands on **3 core pillars**:

**1. People** – The most crucial asset. Includes the project team, managers, clients, and users. Success depends on clear roles, communication, and teamwork.

**2. Process** – Refers to the methodology used (e.g., Agile for fast feedback, Waterfall for strict sequences). A good process brings order and predictability.

**3. Product** – The end goal. All efforts focus on delivering a reliable, functional software product that meets user needs and expectations.

---

### **4.2 Management Spectrum**

SPM focuses on **4 main areas**:

**1. Cost Management** – Creating and sticking to the project budget. Tracks expenses, prevents overruns.

**2. Time Management** – Scheduling tasks, setting deadlines, and ensuring the project is finished on time using tools like CPM/PERT.

**3. Quality Management** – Ensuring that every piece of code meets defined standards through testing, reviews, and QA tools.

**4. Risk Management** – Identifying threats (e.g., tech failure, scope creep) early and planning ways to avoid or fix them.

### **5.1 Planning Objectives**

The goal here is to break the big dream into doable steps:

* Define every task needed (coding, testing, docs).
* Assign timelines to each task to keep the flow smooth.
* Allocate resources—like devs, tools, money—wisely.
* Set **milestones** (e.g., “Prototype ready by Month 2”) to track progress.

---

### **5.2 Project Plan**

This is your **gameplay manual**—a document that evolves:

* 📅 **Schedule**: Detailed timeline using tools like Gantt charts or Trello boards.
* 👥 **Resource Allocation**: Who is doing what with which tools.
* ⚠️ **Risk Management**: What can go wrong and what’s the plan B.

It's not static—it changes as your project grows or hits issues.

---

### **5.3 Types of Project Plans**

| **Plan Type**        | **Purpose**                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Development Plan** | Guides the whole SDLC—design, coding, testing, deployment.  |
| **Quality Plan**     | Defines QA goals, testing methods, and acceptance criteria. |
| **Risk Plan**        | Lists potential risks + action plans to handle them early.  |

Each plan focuses on a specific domain but together, they keep the project safe and on track.

---

### **5.4 Structure of a Software Project Management Plan (SPMP)**

1. **Introduction** – Project goals, scope, constraints, assumptions.
2. **Project Organization** – Defines team hierarchy, roles, responsibilities.
3. **Risk Analysis** – Highlights technical, schedule, and cost-related risks.
4. **Schedule** – Includes timelines, key milestones, task dependencies.
5. **Budget** – Cost estimates for labor, tools, licenses, infra, etc.

It’s like the **master file** that holds everything the team needs to stay aligned.

### **6.1 Estimation Methods**

| **Method**           | **Description**                              | **Example**                             |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Expert Judgment**  | Based on experience of devs/PMs.             | "Login module took 3 weeks last time."  |
| **Delphi Technique** | Experts give anonymous estimates → averaged. | Team does blind estimates, avoids bias. |
| **Function Points**  | Measures app size by features.               | "100 FP app might take \~2 dev-months." |

These help predict how long, how hard, and how costly a feature is.

---

### **6.2 Estimation Models**

**🔸 COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model)**
Used in traditional planning when codebase size (in KLOC) is known.
Formula: `Effort = a × (KLOC)^b`
Where `a` and `b` are constants depending on project type.

* More KLOC = more dev time.
* Good for large projects with historical data.

**🔸 Agile Estimation (Story Points)**

* Tasks rated by **complexity**, not time.
* 1 → trivial, 3 → moderate, 5/8 → tough.
* Helps in sprint planning & velocity tracking.

---

### **6.3 Decision Process**

When choosing between options (like tools or architectures):

1. **Identify Options** (e.g., React Native vs. native dev).
2. **Evaluate Costs, Risks, Time** (e.g., skills, learning curve).
3. **Select the Best Fit** based on long-term ROI.

🧠 Example:
Instead of native apps, choose React Native to reuse 70% code.

---

### 💡 **Quick Cheatsheet**

* **Vision** = Why (Goal) → “Enable quick online payments.”
* **Scope** = What (Coverage) → “Only UPI & credit cards.”
* **COCOMO** = Estimates using KLOC.
* **Agile Estimation** = Uses story points, no fixed hours.
