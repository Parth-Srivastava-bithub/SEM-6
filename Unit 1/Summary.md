* **WAN (Wide Area Network):** A WAN is a network that covers a large geographical area, facilitating global communication and connecting geographically dispersed networks.
* **Organization of Internet:** The internet is a hierarchical and decentralized structure of interconnected networks that uses a unique addressing system (IP addresses) and a common protocol (IP) to enable global communication.
* **ISP (Internet Service Provider):** An ISP is a company that provides individuals and organizations with access to the internet and related services.
* **Data Communication:** Data communication is the process of exchanging data between devices over a medium following specific rules.
* **Transmission Mode:** Transmission mode defines the direction of data flow between devices: simplex (one-way), half-duplex (one at a time), or full-duplex (both ways simultaneously).
* **Network Structure and Architecture (Revisited):** Network structure and architecture encompass the physical and logical design of a network, including its topology, protocols, hardware, and software.
* **Types of Network Architecture (Peer-to-Peer and Client/Server):** Peer-to-peer networks have equal computers sharing resources, while client/server networks have central servers providing services to client computers.
* **Client/Server Network (Detailed):** A client/server network uses a central server to provide resources and services to client devices, offering centralized management and enhanced security.
* **Layering:** Layering is a design principle that divides network communication into manageable layers, each with specific functions.
* **Layering Principles:** Layering principles emphasize the need for bidirectional functionality within each layer and identical protocols at corresponding layers on communicating devices.
* **Services Offered by Layers:** Network layers offer either connection-oriented services that establish a connection before data transfer or connectionless services that send data packets independently without a prior connection.
* **Service Primitives (Operations):** Service primitives are the specific operations that a network layer offers to the layer above it for requesting and using its services.
* **The OSI Reference Model (Detailed):** The OSI Reference Model is a seven-layer framework that describes the different stages of network communication, from the application you use to the physical transmission of data.
* **TCP/IP Protocol Suite (Detailed):** The TCP/IP protocol suite is a practical model with typically four or five layers that defines the communication standards for the internet and most modern networks.
* **Application Layer (TCP/IP):** The Application Layer provides protocols that allow end-user applications to communicate over the network.
* **Network Devices and Components (Detailed):** Hubs, bridges, switches, routers, and WAPs are essential hardware components that enable communication and connectivity in computer networks, each with specific functionalities and roles.
* **Network Topology (Definition):** Network topology describes the physical arrangement of network devices and their interconnections, influencing the network's characteristics and performance.
* **Bus Topology:** Bus topology connects all devices to a single cable, which acts as a shared communication line.
* **Ring Topology:** Ring topology connects devices in a closed loop, with data traveling in one direction around the ring.
* **Star Topology:** Star topology connects all devices to a central hub or switch, through which all communication passes.
* **Mesh Topology:** Mesh topology interconnects devices with many redundant connections, providing multiple paths for data.
* **Hybrid Topology:** Hybrid topology combines two or more different network topologies to create a more flexible design.
* **Tree Topology:** Tree topology combines star and bus structures in a hierarchy, allowing for large networks and easy expansion but with potential single points of failure.
* **Transmission Media (Definition):** Transmission media are the physical pathways or communication channels that transmit data from the sender to the receiver.
* **Guided Media:** Guided media (wired) use a physical conductor to transmit signals, offering security and often high speeds.
* **Coaxial Cable:** Coaxial cable offers higher frequency than twisted pair with better shielding, commonly used for TV and older Ethernet.
* **Fiber Optic Cable:** Fiber optic cable uses light for very high-speed transmission with low attenuation and immunity to EMI.
* **Unguided Transmission:** Unguided media (wireless) transmit electromagnetic waves through the air or space.
* **Radio Waves:** Radio waves are used for omnidirectional wireless communication over medium to long distances.
* **Microwaves:** Microwaves are high-frequency radio waves used for point-to-point and satellite communication.
* **Infrared Transmission:** Infrared transmission uses short-range light waves for communication, commonly found in remote controls and some short-distance data transfer.
* **Digital to Digital Encoding:** Digital to digital encoding converts binary data into digital signals using various line coding techniques to facilitate transmission over physical media.
* **RZ (Return-to-Zero) Encoding:** RZ encoding returns the signal to zero voltage in the middle of each bit interval for synchronization.
* **Manchester Encoding:** Manchester encoding represents bits with a mid-bit transition, with the direction indicating the bit value, and always has a transition for synchronization.
* **Differential Manchester Encoding:** Differential Manchester encoding uses the presence or absence of a transition at the beginning of a bit interval to represent the bit value, with a mid-bit transition for synchronization.
* **Bipolar Encoding:** Bipolar encoding uses three voltage levels (positive, negative, zero) to represent binary data, with alternating polarity for 1s (AMI).
* **Network Performance:** Network performance is evaluated using metrics like bandwidth (capacity), throughput (actual transfer rate), latency (delay), and the bandwidth-delay product (amount of data in transit).
* **Transmission Impairment:** Transmission impairments like attenuation, distortion, and noise can degrade the quality of the received signal.
* **Switching Techniques:** Switching techniques like circuit switching (dedicated paths), message switching (store-and-forward whole messages), and packet switching (breaking messages into independent packets) enable efficient data routing in networks.
* **Multiplexing:** Multiplexing combines multiple signals for simultaneous transmission over a single link, with techniques like FDM (frequency), WDM (wavelength), and TDM (time) used to share the medium's capacity efficiently.
* **ISP Tiers:** ISP tiers describe a hierarchical structure (Tier 1, 2, 3) based on how ISPs connect to the internet backbone and each other, with Tier 1 forming the global backbone, Tier 2 operating regionally, and Tier 3 providing local access.
